# Autonomous-BOAT
This robot automatically avoid the obstracles and find the direction by using
  a LiDAR sensor sweeping in front of the robot.
  
This version has been modified for a boat so it has:
RC input for throttle and rudder, 
outputs for left and right ESC and outputs for single throttle and rudder
